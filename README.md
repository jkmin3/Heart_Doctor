# Heart_Doctor

## Pygame

In this project I used data on patients with heart issues. I used pygame to visualize data through classes and saving them as images to show them through pygame. I gathered a lot of inspiration from this project, but I tried to take a different approach by not using pygame's functions.  

Feel free to use the code and play around with it yourself!
